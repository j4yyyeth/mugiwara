Mugiwara is a fun and engaging 2D pirate-themed game built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Canvas. The objective of the game is to shoot pirate ships with a cannon as they sail across the screen. Players can rack up an unlimited score, but beware ... let five ships pass your view, and the game is over.
